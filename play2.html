        <h3>SCENE III. A hall in the castle.
            <h4 class="name">IAGO</h4>
<p class="IAGO">And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?</p>
<h4 class="name">CASSIO</h4>
<p class="CASSIO">She is indeed perfection.</p>
<h4 class="name">IAGO</h4>
<p class="IAGO">Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I
have a stoup of wine; and here without are a brace
of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to
the health of black Othello.</p>
<h4 class="name">CASSIO</h4>
<p class="speech CASSIO">Not to-night, good Iago: I have very poor and
unhappy brains for drinking: I could well wish
courtesy would invent some other custom of
entertainment.</p>
