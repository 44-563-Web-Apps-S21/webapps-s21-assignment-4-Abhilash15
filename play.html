        <h2>Othello</h2>
        <h3>SCENE III. A hall in the castle.</h3>
        <p>
           <h4> OTHELLO </h4>
<p>Good Michael, look you to the guard to-night:
Let's teach ourselves that honourable stop,
Not to outsport discretion.</p>
<h4>CASSIO</h4>
<p>Iago hath direction what to do;
But, notwithstanding, with my personal eye
Will I look to't.</p>
<h4>OTHELLO</h4>
<p>Iago is most honest.
<p>Michael, good night: to-morrow with your earliest
Let me have speech with you.
</p>
<p>To DESDEMONA</p>

<p>
Come, my dear love,
The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;
That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you.
Good night.
Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants
</p>

<p>Enter IAGO</p>

<h4>CASSIO</h4>
Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch.
<h4>IAGO</h4>
<p>Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the
clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love
of his Desdemona; who let us not therefore blame:
he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; and
she is sport for Jove.
</p>
<h4>CASSIO</h4>
<p>She's a most exquisite lady.</p>
<h4>IAGO</h4>
And, I'll warrant her, fun of game.
<h4>CASSIO</h4>
<p>Indeed, she's a most fresh and delicate creature.</p>
<h4>IAGO</h4>
<p>What an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley of
provocation.</p>
<h4>CASSIO</h4>
An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.
